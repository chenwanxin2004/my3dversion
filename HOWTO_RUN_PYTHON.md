## How to Run Python Example Codes

### Prerequisites
* Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) (or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/))
* Install the following required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  ```
  numpy
  matplotlib
  scipy
  opencv-python
  opencv-contrib-python
  ```
* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mint-lab/3dv_tutorial.git`
  * You need to move your working directory where you want to copy the repository.
  * Or you can download [example codes and slides as a ZIP file](https://github.com/sunglok/3dv_tutorial/archive/master.zip) and unzip it where you want.


### Running Examples in Console
1. Move to the directory where example codes exist: `cd examples`
2. Run an example (e.g. `image_formation.py`): `python image_formation.py`
    * Or you can run an example on your favorite Python IDE or editor.
